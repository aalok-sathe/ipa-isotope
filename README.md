## Features to try

-   Filtering the phones by
    -   voicing (voiced/voiceless)
    -   place of articulation (labial/dental/alveolar/palatal/velar/uvular/pharyngeal/glottal)
    -   manner of articulation (stop or plosive/trill/tap or flap/fricative/affricate/sibilant/approximant)
    -   properties (sonority > 5)
-   Sorting the phones by
    -   symbol
    -   sonority
-   Controls
    -   reorder the phones into their original order
    -   shuffle the phones into a random order
    -   scramble them over the page
    -   toggle attributes (name/symbol/sonority) on/off
    -   choose between pastel and glass themes
    -   drag the phones around with the little = sign on their bottom right!
    -   click the play button to hear the phone [WIP]
    -   extra: click around the particles on the webpage background to create more webs!

We welcome any feature or other suggestions!
